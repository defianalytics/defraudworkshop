We welcome many kinds of papers, such as, but not limited to:

- Novel research papers
- Work that will be presented at KDD
- Demo papers
- Work-in-progress papers
- Papers on case studies of benchmark data
- Relevant work that has been previously published

While we aim for a focus on the theme of fairness and transparency, we welcome papers addressing any other challenges at large of the subject area. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

- **Interleaved detection and description of outliers:**
  - Description models for given outliers
  - Pattern and local information based outlier description
  - Subspace outliers, feature selection, and space transformations
  - Ensemble methods for anomaly detection and description
  - Descriptive local outlier ranking
  - Identification of outlier rules
  - Finding intensional knowledge
  - Contextual and community outliers
  - Human-in-the-loop modeling and learning
  - Visualization techniques for interactive exploration of outliers
  - Comparative studies on outlier description
- **Outlier mining for complex databases:**
  - Graph data (e.g. community outliers)
  - Spatio-temporal data
  - Time series and sequential data
  - Online processing of stream data
  - Scalability to high dimensional data
- **Formal outlier mining models:**

  - Spectral models
  - Constraint-based models
  - Ensemble models
- **Applications of outlier detection and description:**
  - Fraud in financial data
  - Intrusions in communication networks

All papers will be peer reviewed and **double-blinded**. Submissions must be in PDF, **no more than 9 pages long (including references) — shorter papers are welcome** — and formatted according to the standard double-column ACM Proceedings Style. Every effort must be made to preserve the anonymity of the authors. Authors may submit (optional) supplementary material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary materials must be in PDF or ZIP format. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. To submit supplementary material, first upload your submission. You will then be able to upload supplementary material from the author console. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.

The accepted papers will be published on the workshop’s website and will not be considered archival for resubmission purposes. Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a poster session, and some set will also be chosen for oral presentation.

For paper submission, please proceed to the submission website.
