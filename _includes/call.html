    <p>All papers will be peer reviewed and <strong>double-blinded</strong>. Submissions must be in PDF, <strong>
        no more than 9 pages long (including
        references) — shorter papers are welcome
      </strong> — and formatted according to the standard double-column ACM Proceedings Style.
      Every effort must be made to preserve the anonymity of the authors. Authors may submit (optional) supplementary
      material, such as appendices, proofs, derivations, data, or source code; all supplementary materials must be in
      PDF or
      ZIP format. Like submissions, supplementary material must be anonymized. To submit supplementary material, first
      upload
      your submission. You will then be able to upload supplementary material from the author console. Looking at
      supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.</p>
    <p>The accepted papers will be published on the workshop’s website and will not be considered archival for
      resubmission
      purposes. Authors whose papers are accepted to the workshop will have the opportunity to participate in a poster
      session, and some set will also be chosen for oral presentation.</p>
    <p>For paper submission, please proceed to the submission website.</p>
    <p>Please send enquiries to siddharth@comp.nus.edu.sg</p>
